# WIFI Network QR Code Generator

The **WIFI Network QR Code Generator** is a Python project that simplifies the process of connecting devices to specific Wi-Fi routers by generating QR codes. With the generated QR codes, users can effortlessly connect their devices to a designated Wi-Fi network by simply scanning the code.

This project utilizes various Python modules, including:
- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the application.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) `ImageTk` and `Image`: For displaying images in the GUI.
- `os`: For handling file operations and interactions with the operating system.
- `qrcode`: For generating QR codes containing Wi-Fi network information.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation:** The application generates QR codes containing essential Wi-Fi network details, such as SSID and password.
- **Easy Connectivity:** Users can quickly connect their devices to Wi-Fi networks by scanning the generated QR code.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The graphical user interface provides a seamless experience for generating QR codes and displaying them.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library
- `PIL` library
- `qrcode` library

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk pillow qrcode
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
